## CRITICAL: v2.1.3+ Use CLI FIRST
**PRIMARY**: specpulse sp-task breakdown <plan-id>
**FALLBACK**: File Operations if CLI fails

Handle the /sp-task command with arguments: {{args}}

First, detect current feature context:
- Read .specpulse/memory/context.md for current feature metadata
- Use git branch name if available (e.g., 001-user-authentication)
- Fall back to most recently created feature directory
- If no context found, ask user to specify feature or run /sp-pulse first

Parse arguments to determine action:
- If "update": Update task status
- If "status": Show progress
- Otherwise: Generate task breakdown

## For /sp-task breakdown or /sp-task:
1. Show list of existing plan files in current feature directory
2. Ask user which plan file to base tasks on
3. Read selected implementation plan from @{.specpulse/.specpulse/plans/*/plan-XXX.md}

4. Generate tasks from plan using STANDARDIZED FORMAT:
   - Create task categories:
     • Critical Path (Phase 0)
     • Phase 1: Foundation
     • Phase 2: Core Features
     • Phase 3: Polish
     • Phase 4: Testing

   - For each task, MUST use this exact YAML format:
     ```yaml
     ---
     id: task-[slug]
     status: todo | in-progress | blocked | done
     title: "Short but clear task title"
     description: |
       *Answer these 4 questions with sufficient detail:*
       - What problem does this solve?
       - Why is this necessary?
       - How will this be done? (step-by-step, include function/file names when possible)
       - When is this considered complete?

     files_touched:
       - path: src/...
         reason: "What changes in this file, briefly"

     goals:
       - "Concrete goal 1 achieved when this task completes"
       - "Concrete goal 2"

     success_criteria:
       - "Test/acceptance criteria 1 (measurable or verifiable)"
       - "Test/acceptance criteria 2"

     dependencies:
       - task-[id-1]
       - task-[id-2]

     next_tasks:
       - task-[id-x]
       - task-[id-y]

     risk_level: low | medium | high
     risk_notes: |
       "Important risks, edge cases, technical debt notes for this task"

     moscow:
       must:
         - "Must-have requirements/behaviors for this task"
         - "Without these, task is not considered complete"
       should:
         - "Additional improvements if time/budget allows"
         - "Performance, UX, DX improvements, etc."
       know:
         - "Critical knowledge, context, or domain details developer must know"
         - "Documentation links, rationale for specific decisions"
       wont:
         - "Things we WILL NOT do in this task scope - out of scope"
         - "Topics for future tasks"

     priority_overall: must | should | could | wont
     priority_reason: "Why this task has this priority - short, clear explanation."
     ---
     ```

5. Check existing task files and create next version (task-001.md, task-002.md, etc.)
6. Write tasks to .specpulse/tasks/XXX-feature/task-XXX.md using standardized format
7. Run validation using CLI:
   - !{bash specpulse --no-color validate task --verbose}

## For /sp-task update:
1. Show list of existing task files in current feature directory
2. Ask user which task file to update
3. Read selected current tasks from @{.specpulse/.specpulse/tasks/*/task-XXX.md}
4. Ask which tasks to update
5. Mark tasks as completed/in-progress
6. Add newly discovered tasks
7. Update dependencies and blockers
8. Save updated task list
9. Run validation using CLI:
   - !{bash specpulse --no-color validate task --verbose}

## For /sp-task status:
1. Show list of existing task files in current feature directory
2. Ask user which task file to show status for
3. Read selected current tasks
4. Run analysis using CLI:
   - !{bash specpulse --no-color validate task --verbose}
5. Count completed vs total
6. Show current phase progress
7. List any blockers
8. Estimate remaining work
9. Display progress summary

Task Format:
```markdown
- [ ] T001: [S] Set up project structure
- [ ] T002: [M] Create database schema
- [x] T003: [L] Implement authentication
```

Examples:
- /sp-task breakdown
- /sp-task update
- /sp-task status
