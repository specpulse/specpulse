## CRITICAL: LLM Workflow Rules

**PRIMARY WORKFLOW: Use CLI when available**
- Prefer `specpulse spec create/update/validate` when those commands exist
- Use Bash tool ONLY for CLI commands, not for file editing
- Only use Read/Write/Edit tools for specs/ files when CLI doesn't cover the operation

**PROTECTED DIRECTORIES (NEVER EDIT):**
- templates/ - Template files
- .specpulse/ - Internal config
- specpulse/ - Package code
- .claude/ and .gemini/ - AI configuration

**WORKFLOW:**
1. Try `specpulse spec create "description"` first
2. If CLI doesn't exist or doesn't cover your need, use File Operations
3. Templates are READ from templates/, then specs are CREATED/EDITED in specs/

## Command: /sp-spec {{args}}

Create, update, or validate feature specifications using SpecPulse methodology.

Actions: create, update, validate, clarify (defaults to create)

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Detect current feature context**:
   - Read memory/context.md for current feature metadata
   - Use git branch name if available (e.g., 001-user-authentication)
   - Fall back to most recently created feature directory
   - If no context found, ask user to specify feature or run /sp-pulse first

2. **Parse arguments** to determine action:
   - If starts with 'create': Generate new specification
   - If starts with 'update': Modify existing specification
   - If starts with 'validate': Check specification completeness
   - If starts with 'clarify': Address [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   - Default to 'create' with full arguments as description

3. **Run specification validation using CLI (optional)**:
   !{bash specpulse validate spec}

   Note: Validation is optional - manual checks are primary

4. **For 'create' action**:
   - Read template from @{templates/spec.md}
   - Parse description to identify:
     * Functional requirements (Must/Should/Could/Won't have)
     * User stories with testable acceptance criteria
     * Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
     * Technical constraints and dependencies
   - Fill template with AI-generated content
   - Mark unclear items with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
   - Create numbered spec file (spec-001.md, spec-002.md, etc.)
   - Save to specs/XXX-feature/spec-XXX.md

5. **Generate comprehensive specification**:
   - Executive Summary
   - Problem Statement
   - Proposed Solution
   - Functional Requirements (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)
   - Non-Functional Requirements (performance, security, scalability)
   - User Stories with acceptance criteria
   - Technical Constraints
   - Dependencies
   - Risks and Mitigations
   - Success Criteria
   - Open Questions marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

6. **For 'update' action**:
   - Show list of existing spec files
   - Ask user which spec file to update
   - Read selected specification
   - Ask for clarifications or changes
   - Update content while preserving structure
   - Remove resolved [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers

7. **For 'validate' action**:
   - Show list of existing spec files
   - Run validation script
   - Check all required sections are filled
   - Count [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   - Verify acceptance criteria are testable
   - Report validation results

8. **Update context and validate**:
   - Update memory/context.md with specification status
   - Check SDD compliance (Principle 1: Specification First)
   - Validate all sections are filled
   - Report any missing or incomplete sections

### Example AI-Generated Content:
For "User authentication with OAuth2":
- FR-001: System SHALL support OAuth2 authentication with Google/GitHub
- FR-002: System SHALL issue JWT tokens valid for 24 hours
- NFR-001: Authentication response time < 200ms
- User Story: As a user, I want to login with Google so that I don't need to remember another password

### SDD Compliance Checklist:
- [ ] Every requirement is testable (Principle 1)
- [ ] User stories have clear acceptance criteria (Principle 1)
- [ ] Dependencies are identified (Principle 4)
- [ ] Success metrics defined (Principle 6)

Examples:
- /sp-spec user authentication with OAuth2 and email/password
- /sp-spec update
- /sp-spec validate
- /sp-spec clarify
