[command.prompt]
text = """
Validate project components for completeness and SDD compliance.

Usage:
  /sp-validate        # Validate current spec
  /sp-validate spec   # Validate specifications
  /sp-validate plan   # Validate plans
  /sp-validate task   # Validate tasks
  /sp-validate all    # Validate everything

Implementation:

1. Parse validation target (spec/plan/task/all)

2. For spec validation:
   - Read spec file
   - Check required sections
   - Count [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   - Verify acceptance criteria format
   - Run: specpulse validate spec --verbose

3. For plan validation:
   - Read plan file
   - Check phases defined
   - Verify dependencies
   - Run: specpulse validate plan

4. For task validation:
   - Read task files
   - Check status fields
   - Verify dependencies
   - Run: specpulse validate task

5. Report results:
   - Show validation status
   - List missing sections
   - Count clarifications
   - Suggest next steps

Example Output:

✓ Specification Validation
  File: .specpulse/specs/001-auth/spec-001.md
  Status: Complete
  Sections: 12/12
  Clarifications: 0

  → Next: /sp-plan generate

Or with issues:

✗ Specification Validation
  File: .specpulse/specs/001-auth/spec-001.md
  Status: Incomplete

  Missing:
    - Risk assessment
    - Deployment strategy

  Clarifications: 3

  → Next: /sp-clarify
