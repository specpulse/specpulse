Execute tasks continuously from the task list without stopping between tasks.

Arguments: {{args}}

CRITICAL: This is NON-STOP EXECUTION mode. You must:
1. Execute the current/next task
2. Mark it as completed
3. Immediately move to the next task
4. Continue until ALL tasks are done or blocked

NO STOPPING between tasks unless:
- All tasks are completed
- Remaining tasks are blocked
- An error occurs requiring user intervention
- User explicitly stops you

## Steps:

1. Run: scripts/sp-pulse-execute.sh {{args}}

2. Analyze the output to identify:
   - Next task to execute (T001 or AUTH-T001 format)
   - Total pending tasks
   - Current progress percentage

3. For each task:
   - Read task description from task file
   - Implement the solution
   - Test if applicable
   - Mark as completed: [ ] → [x]
   - Move to next task WITHOUT PAUSING

4. Continue executing until:
   - All tasks completed
   - Hit a blocker
   - Critical error
   - User says "stop"

## Execution Modes:

- No arguments or "next": Execute next pending task and continue
- "all": Execute ALL pending tasks non-stop
- Specific task (T001, AUTH-T001): Start from that task

## Rules:

- NO EXPLANATIONS between tasks
- NO WAITING for confirmation
- NO SUMMARIES after each task
- Just execute and continue

## Final Report:

Only after ALL tasks done:
```
Execution Complete
Progress: 100% (25/25 tasks)
✓ 25 tasks completed
Ready for validation
```

Execute efficiently and continuously!
