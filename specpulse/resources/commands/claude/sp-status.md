# /sp-status Command

Track progress across all features or get detailed status of a specific feature.

## Usage
```
/sp-status [feature-name]
```

## Implementation

When called with `/sp-status $ARGUMENTS`, I will:

1. **Parse arguments** to determine scope:
   - If feature name provided: Show detailed status for that feature
   - Otherwise: Show overview of all features

2. **Read feature context** from `memory/context.md`

3. **For `/sp-status` (all features overview):**
   - Scan all feature directories (specs/*, plans/*, tasks/*)
   - Count features by status: active, completed, in_progress, paused
   - Calculate overall project progress
   - Show summary statistics:
     ```
     TOTAL_FEATURES=5
     ACTIVE_FEATURES=2
     COMPLETED_FEATURES=1
     IN_PROGRESS_FEATURES=1
     PAUSED_FEATURES=1
     OVERALL_PROGRESS=42%
     ```
   - List all features with their status and progress percentage
   - Highlight current active feature from context

4. **For `/sp-status [feature-name]` (detailed feature status):**
   - Detect feature directory (using context detection logic)
   - Read all task files in the feature's tasks directory
   - Calculate completion percentage based on task status
   - Show detailed breakdown:
     ```
     FEATURE: 001-user-authentication
     STATUS: active
     PROGRESS: 65%
     SPECS: 2 files
     PLANS: 1 file  
     TASKS: 1 file (25 total tasks)
     COMPLETED_TASKS: 16
     IN_PROGRESS_TASKS: 5
     BLOCKED_TASKS: 1
     LAST_UPDATED: 2025-01-09
     ```
   - Show phase-by-phase progress
   - List any blockers or issues
   - Provide recommendations for next steps

5. **Progress calculation logic:**
   - Scan task files for completion status: `[x]` for completed, `[ ]` for pending, `[-]` for in progress, `[!]` for blocked
   - Calculate percentages: completed / total * 100
   - Track trends over time if historical data available

## Feature Status Indicators

- **Active**: Currently being worked on (in context.md)
- **Completed**: All tasks marked as complete
- **In Progress**: Has task files with some completed tasks
- **Paused**: No recent activity, not all tasks complete
- **Blocked**: Has blocked tasks preventing progress

## Examples

### All features overview
```
User: /sp-status
```

I will display:
```
