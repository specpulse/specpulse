## Command: /sp-continue [feature-id|feature-name]

**CLI-Independent Feature Context Switching**

When called with `/sp-continue {{args}}`, I will:

### Step 1: Parse Arguments to Determine Action

**I will analyze the arguments:**
- If feature ID/name provided: Switch to that feature
- If no argument: List all available features for selection
- Validate input format (XXX-feature-name or just feature-name)

### Step 2: For Listing Available Features

**I will scan and display all features:**

#### A. Feature Discovery
- Scan `.specpulse/specs/`, `.specpulse/plans/`, `.specpulse/tasks/` directories
- Identify all feature directories using naming convention (XXX-feature-name)
- Display each feature with:
  - Feature ID and name
  - Progress percentage (if tasks exist)
  - File counts (specs, plans, tasks)
  - Last activity timestamp
  - Current status indicator

#### B. Feature Analysis
For each feature, I will determine:
- **Active**: Currently has open tasks or recent activity
- **Completed**: All tasks marked as done
- **In Progress**: Has some completed tasks with work remaining
- **Paused**: No recent activity but not all tasks complete
- **Blocked**: Has blocked tasks preventing progress

#### C. Display Feature Selection Interface
Show features with progress indicators and provide multiple selection methods:
- Use number (1-4)
- Use feature ID (001, 002, etc.)
- Use feature name (user-auth, payment, etc.)
- Type 'cancel' to abort

### Step 3: For Feature Context Switching

**I will perform comprehensive context switch:**

#### A. Feature Detection and Validation
- Parse feature identifier (extract ID from XXX-feature-name)
- Validate feature directory exists and is properly structured
- Check for required `.specpulse` organization
- Verify feature has content (specs, plans, or tasks)

#### B. Context Analysis
- Analyze feature structure and content
- Identify current progress status
- Check for active work or incomplete tasks
- Detect any blockers or issues

#### C. Update Memory Context
- Update `.specpulse/memory/context.md` with new active feature
- Set current working directory context
- Record feature switch history
- Update feature status and metadata

#### D. Git Integration
- Check if feature branch exists
- Switch to feature branch if available
- Create feature branch if missing
- Update git working directory context

### Step 4: Context Switch Validation

**I will verify successful context switch:**
- Confirm feature directory is accessible
- Validate memory context updated correctly
- Check file permissions and structure
- Verify git branch (if applicable)

### Step 5: Display Feature Summary

**After successful switch, I will show:**
- Feature name and ID
- Current progress status
- Available files (specs, plans, tasks)
- Last activity information
- Recommended next steps
- Any active work or blockers

## Context Memory Structure

**The feature context is stored in `.specpulse/memory/context.md`:**
```yaml
---
context_version: "1.0"
last_updated: "2025-01-11T15:30:00Z"
active_feature:
  id: "002"
  name: "payment-processing"
  directory: "002-payment-processing"
  status: "in_progress"
  progress: 23
  created_at: "2025-01-10T09:00:00Z"
  last_activity: "2025-01-11T14:20:00Z"
git_context:
  branch: "feature/002-payment-processing"
  remote: "origin"
  commit_hash: "abc123def"
working_directory: "/project/root/.specpulse/specs/002-payment-processing"
feature_history:
  - feature_id: "001"
    name: "user-authentication"
    switched_from: "2025-01-11T15:30:00Z"
    duration: "2 days 4 hours"
  - feature_id: "002"
    name: "payment-processing"
    switched_to: "2025-01-11T15:30:00Z"
---
```

## Advanced Features

### Feature Search and Fuzzy Matching
- Partial name matching (e.g., "auth" matches "user-authentication")
- ID pattern matching (e.g., "00" matches all features starting with 00)
- Status-based filtering (show only active, completed, or paused features)

### Bulk Operations
- List features by progress percentage
- Show features with specific file types
- Display features sorted by last activity
- Filter features by completion status

### Context Presets
- Save frequently used feature combinations
- Quick switch between related features
- Bookmark important feature contexts

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Feature Not Found
- **Invalid feature ID**: Suggest valid feature IDs from available list
- **Feature directory missing**: Guide through feature discovery process
- **Empty feature**: Recommend running `/sp-pulse` to create feature

### Permission Issues
- **Directory access denied**: Provide permission fix instructions
- **File write errors**: Guide through permission corrections
- **Git operation failures**: Offer manual git command alternatives

### Context Recovery
- **Memory file corrupted**: Rebuild from available features
- **Git branch issues**: Work without git integration
- **Feature structure invalid**: Provide repair instructions

This `/sp-continue` command provides **seamless feature context switching** without requiring any SpecPulse CLI installation, using only validated file operations and comprehensive context management.
