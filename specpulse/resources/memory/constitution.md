# Project Constitution
*Immutable principles that govern all development through Specification-Driven Development (SDD)*

## The Nine Articles of Specification-Driven Development

### Article I: Library-First Principle
Every feature in this project MUST begin its existence as a standalone library. No feature shall be implemented directly within application code without first being abstracted into a reusable library component.

**Rationale**: This ensures modularity, reusability, and clear boundaries between features.

### Article II: CLI Interface Mandate
Every library MUST expose its core functionality through a command-line interface.

All CLI interfaces MUST:
- Accept text as input (via stdin, arguments, or files)
- Produce text as output (via stdout)
- Support JSON format for structured data exchange
- Provide --help documentation
- Return appropriate exit codes (0 for success, non-zero for failure)

**Rationale**: This ensures observability, testability, and composability of all components.

### Article III: Test-First Imperative
This is NON-NEGOTIABLE: All implementation MUST follow strict Test-Driven Development.

No implementation code shall be written before:
1. Unit tests are written and documented
2. Tests are validated and approved by the user
3. Tests are confirmed to FAIL (Red phase)
4. Implementation makes tests PASS (Green phase)
5. Code is refactored while maintaining passing tests (Refactor phase)

**Rationale**: This ensures correctness, prevents regression, and documents expected behavior.

### Article IV: Specification as Source of Truth
Specifications don't serve codeâ€”code serves specifications. The specification is the primary artifact from which all implementation flows.

Every code change MUST:
- Trace back to a specification requirement
- Update specifications if behavior changes
- Maintain bidirectional traceability

**Rationale**: This eliminates the gap between intent and implementation.

### Article V: Continuous Refinement
Consistency validation happens continuously, not as a one-time gate.

All specifications MUST be:
- Analyzed for ambiguity and contradictions
- Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] for uncertainties
- Validated against the constitution
- Refined based on implementation feedback

**Rationale**: This ensures specifications remain precise, complete, and implementable.

### Article VI: Research-Driven Context
Every technical decision MUST be informed by research.

Before implementation:
- Research agents investigate library options
- Performance implications are documented
- Security considerations are analyzed
- Organizational constraints are identified

**Rationale**: This prevents uninformed decisions and technical debt.

### Article VII: Simplicity and Anti-Abstraction
Start simple, add complexity only when proven necessary.

Requirements:
- Maximum 3 projects/modules for initial implementation
- No future-proofing without documented need
- Use framework features directly (no unnecessary wrappers)
- Single model representation per concept
- Additional complexity requires documented justification

**Rationale**: This prevents over-engineering and maintains maintainability.

### Article VIII: Integration-First Testing
Tests MUST use realistic environments over mocks.

Testing priority:
1. Contract tests (API boundaries)
2. Integration tests (component interaction)
3. End-to-end tests (user workflows)
4. Unit tests (isolated logic)

Use:
- Real databases over mocks
- Actual service instances over stubs
- Production-like data volumes
- Realistic network conditions

**Rationale**: This ensures code works in practice, not just in theory.

### Article IX: Executable Documentation
All documentation MUST be executable or verifiable.

This includes:
- Code examples that can be run
- API contracts that can be tested
- Quickstart guides that can be validated
- Architecture decisions with measurable outcomes

**Rationale**: This prevents documentation drift and ensures accuracy.

## Constitutional Enforcement

### Phase Gates
Every implementation plan MUST pass through constitutional gates:

#### Phase -1: Pre-Implementation Gates
- [ ] Simplicity Gate (Article VII): Using <=3 projects? No future-proofing?
- [ ] Anti-Abstraction Gate (Article VII): Using framework directly? Single model?
- [ ] Test-First Gate (Article III): Tests written? Tests reviewed? Tests failing?
- [ ] Integration-First Gate (Article VIII): Contracts defined? Contract tests written?
- [ ] Research Gate (Article VI): Options researched? Trade-offs documented?

### Complexity Tracking
Any violation of simplicity principles MUST be documented:
```yaml
complexity_exceptions:
  - article: VII
    violation: "Using 4 projects instead of 3"
    justification: "Authentication requires separate service for security isolation"
    approved_by: "Team Lead"
    date: "2025-09-11"
```

### Amendment Process
While principles are immutable, their application can evolve:

1. Proposed amendments require:
   - Explicit documentation of rationale
   - Impact assessment on existing code
   - Backwards compatibility analysis
   - Team consensus

2. Amendments are versioned and dated
3. Original principles remain visible with strikethrough
4. New principles are added with effective date

## Principles in Practice

### When Starting a New Feature
1. Write specification first (Article IV)
2. Research technical options (Article VI)
3. Design as a library (Article I)
4. Expose via CLI (Article II)
5. Write tests first (Article III)
6. Keep it simple (Article VII)
7. Use real environments (Article VIII)

### When Reviewing Code
- Does it trace to a specification? (Article IV)
- Are tests written first? (Article III)
- Is it the simplest solution? (Article VII)
- Does it work with real services? (Article VIII)
- Is documentation executable? (Article IX)

### When Facing Complexity
1. Document why simplicity isn't sufficient
2. Get explicit approval for complexity
3. Track in complexity_exceptions
4. Plan for future simplification

## Technical Standards

### Code Style
- Python: PEP 8 with type hints
- JavaScript/TypeScript: ESLint + Prettier
- Tests: Descriptive names, AAA pattern
- Documentation: Clear, concise, with examples

### Testing Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- All APIs must have contract tests
- Critical paths require E2E tests
- TDD red-green-refactor cycle mandatory

### Performance Targets
- API response time: < 200ms (p95)
- Test execution: < 5 minutes for full suite
- Build time: < 2 minutes
- Specification generation: < 30 seconds

## Development Workflow

### SpecPulse Development Process
1. `specpulse init` - Initialize feature with proper structure
2. `/sp-spec` - Create specification following template guidelines
3. `/sp-plan` - Generate implementation plan with Phase Gates
4. `/sp-task` - Break down into executable tasks
5. Execute with Test-First Development
6. `/sp-validate` - Validate against constitution and specification
7. Update specifications based on learnings

### Version Control
- Feature branches from specifications
- Semantic commit messages
- Specifications versioned with code
- Pull requests reference specifications

### Continuous Integration
- Specification validation on every commit
- Constitutional gate checks in CI
- Test coverage enforcement
- Complexity tracking reports

## Specification Quality Standards

### Completeness Requirements
- [ ] All user stories have acceptance criteria
- [ ] Non-functional requirements documented
- [ ] Edge cases identified
- [ ] Error scenarios defined
- [ ] Success metrics specified

### Clarity Requirements
- [ ] No ambiguous language
- [ ] [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers for unknowns
- [ ] Testable acceptance criteria
- [ ] Measurable success metrics
- [ ] Clear scope boundaries

### Traceability Requirements
- [ ] Requirements numbered for reference
- [ ] User stories linked to requirements
- [ ] Tests trace to acceptance criteria
- [ ] Implementation maps to specifications
- [ ] Changes documented in specification
