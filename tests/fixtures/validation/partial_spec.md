# Specification: Test Feature - Partial (Work in Progress)

## Metadata
- **ID**: SPEC-TEST-002
- **Created**: 2025-10-06
- **Author**: Test Suite
- **Version**: 1.0.0

## Executive Summary
This is a partially complete specification used for testing partial validation. It has some sections filled out but is missing others, representing a work-in-progress spec.

## Problem Statement
Testing partial validation requires a spec that is incomplete but has enough content to calculate meaningful completion percentages and status indicators.

## Proposed Solution
Create a fixture with approximately 40-60% completion that can be used to test progressive validation features.

## Detailed Requirements

### Functional Requirements

FR-001: Partial Content Coverage
  - Acceptance: Some sections complete, others missing
  - Priority: MUST

FR-002: Realistic Incompleteness
  - Acceptance: Missing sections are realistic (not arbitrary)
  - Priority: SHOULD

## User Stories

### Story 1: Developer Builds Spec Incrementally
**As a** developer
**I want** to validate my partial spec
**So that** I can see what's left to complete

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Partial validation shows completion percentage
- [ ] Missing sections are identified
- [ ] Next suggested section is helpful

## Technical Constraints
- Must represent realistic work-in-progress
- Must be usable for testing

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Represents ~40-60% completion
- [ ] Used in partial validation tests
- [ ] Demonstrates progressive validation features
