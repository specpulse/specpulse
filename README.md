## üöÄ Quick Start

### Install

```bash
pip install specpulse
```

### Initialize Project

```bash
# New project
specpulse init my-project --ai claude
cd my-project

# Or add to existing project
cd existing-project
specpulse init --here --ai claude
```

### Start Your First Feature

```bash
# Initialize feature
specpulse feature init user-authentication

# Create specification
specpulse spec create "OAuth2 authentication with JWT tokens"

# Generate implementation plan
specpulse plan create "Secure authentication flow"

# Break into tasks
specpulse task breakdown plan-001
```

### Use AI Commands

In Claude Code or Gemini CLI:

```bash
/sp-pulse payment-system          # Initialize feature
/sp-spec create "Payment processing"  # Create specification
/sp-plan generate                   # Generate implementation plan
/sp-task breakdown                  # Break into tasks
/sp-status                          # Check progress
```

## üìã What It Does

SpecPulse helps you build software systematically:

‚úÖ **Specification First** - Clear specs before coding
‚úÖ **AI-Enhanced** - Works with Claude Code and Gemini CLI
‚úÖ **CLI-First Architecture** - Fast, reliable commands
‚úÖ **Privacy-First** - No external API calls, completely local
‚úÖ **Git Integration** - Automatic branch and context management

---

## ü§ñ AI Integration

### Supported AI Platforms

- **Claude Code** - Custom slash commands (`/sp-*`)
- **Gemini CLI** - Custom commands (`/sp-*`)

### How It Works

**CLI-First Pattern** (v2.1.2+):

```
User Request: /sp-spec OAuth2 login
    ‚Üì
Step 1: Try CLI first
    Bash: specpulse spec create "OAuth2 login"
    ‚Üì
Step 2: If CLI doesn't exist, use File Operations
    Claude reads template, writes file, expands content
```

/sp-status                          # Track progress across features
```

### Specification Commands

/sp-spec validate <spec-id>         # Validate specification
```

### Planning Commands

```bash
/sp-plan generate                    # Generate implementation plan
/sp-plan validate <plan-id>         # Validate plan
```

/sp-execute                         # Execute next pending task and continue
/sp-execute next                    # Same as above
/sp-execute all                     # Execute ALL pending tasks non-stop

/sp-decompose <spec-id>             # Decompose spec into components
/sp-clarify <spec-id>               # Clarify specification
```

## üîÑ Task Execution with /sp-execute

### What is /sp-execute?

`/sp-execute` is a **continuous execution mode** that executes tasks without stopping between them. It implements tasks sequentially and automatically moves to the next task until all are completed or blocked.

### How /sp-execute Works

**Non-Stop Execution Pattern:**

```
/sp-execute
    ‚Üì
Step 1: Find next pending task (T001 or AUTH-T001)
    ‚Üì
Step 2: Mark as in-progress: [ ] ‚Üí [>]
    ‚Üì
Step 3: Implement the task
    ‚Üì
Step 4: Mark as completed: [>] ‚Üí [x]
    ‚Üì
Step 5: Automatically continue to next task
    ‚Üì
Repeat until all tasks complete
```

### /sp-execute Usage

In Claude Code or Gemini CLI:

```bash
# Execute next pending task and continue
/sp-execute

# Execute ALL pending tasks non-stop
/sp-execute all

# Execute specific task and continue with related tasks
/sp-execute T001
/sp-execute AUTH-T001
```

### Task Status Markers

- `[ ]` - Pending task (ready to execute)
- `[>]` - In progress (currently working on)
- `[x]` - Completed (done)
- `[!]` - Blocked (waiting for dependency)

### Continuous Execution Example

```bash
# User: /sp-execute

# AI response:
Found 15 pending tasks
Starting with T001: Implementing user model...
‚úì User model created
Moving to T002: Creating authentication service...
‚úì Authentication service implemented
Continue with T003, T004, T005... WITHOUT STOPPING
All 15 tasks completed successfully!
```

### Batch Execution

```bash
# User: /sp-execute all

# AI response:
Processing ALL pending tasks in one go
No interruptions or pauses
Complete the entire task list
Final report only
```

### Non-Stop Execution Rules

**CRITICAL**: `/sp-execute` follows strict non-stop execution rules:

1. **NO EXPLANATIONS** between tasks - just execute
2. **NO WAITING** for confirmation - keep going
3. **NO SUMMARIES** after each task - save for the end
4. **ONLY STOP** when:
   - All tasks completed
   - Hit a blocker
   - Critical error occurs
   - User explicitly says "stop"

### Workflow Integration

#### Starting Fresh

```bash
/sp-pulse new-feature
/sp-spec "Create user authentication with OAuth2"
/sp-plan
/sp-task
/sp-execute all    # Complete everything!
```

#### Resuming Work

```bash
/sp-continue 001-user-auth
/sp-execute        # Continue from where we left off
```

### Error Handling

If an error occurs during task execution:
1. Mark task as blocked: `[!]`
2. Note the error in task file
3. Skip to next available task
4. Continue execution
5. Report all blockers at the end

### Progress Tracking

During execution, AI maintains:
- Task completion counter
- Progress percentage
- List of completed tasks
- List of any blockers encountered

### Final Report Example

```
## Execution Complete

**Progress**: 100% (25/25 tasks)
**Duration**: Continuous execution
**Status**: All tasks completed

### Summary
‚úì 25 tasks completed
‚úó 0 tasks blocked
‚Üí 0 tasks remaining

Ready for validation: /sp-validate
```

### Benefits of /sp-execute

- **Maximum efficiency** - No time wasted between tasks
- **Flow state** - Continuous productive work
- **Rapid delivery** - Complete features faster
- **Reduced context switching** - Stay focused on implementation
- **Automated workflow** - Let AI handle the execution

**Perfect for**: Completing entire feature sets, maintaining momentum, and rapid prototyping.
