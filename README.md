## üöÄ Quick Start

### Install

```bash
pip install specpulse
```

### Initialize Project

```bash
# New project
specpulse init my-project --ai claude
cd my-project

# Or add to existing project
cd existing-project
specpulse init --here --ai claude
```

### Start Your First Feature

```bash
# Initialize feature
specpulse feature init user-authentication

# CLI creates empty template
specpulse spec create "OAuth2 authentication with JWT tokens"

# AI ESSENTIAL: Expand specification with details
# In Claude Code or Gemini CLI:
/sp-spec expand "OAuth2 authentication with JWT tokens"

# Generate implementation plan (CLI creates template)
specpulse plan create "Secure authentication flow"

# AI ESSENTIAL: Expand plan with detailed steps
# In Claude Code or Gemini CLI:
/sp-plan expand "Secure authentication flow"

# Break into tasks (CLI creates template)
specpulse task breakdown plan-001

# AI ESSENTIAL: Create detailed task breakdown
# In Claude Code or Gemini CLI:
/sp-task expand plan-001
```

### Use AI Commands

In Claude Code or Gemini CLI:

```bash
/sp-pulse payment-system          # Initialize feature
/sp-spec create "Payment processing"  # Create specification
/sp-plan generate                   # Generate implementation plan
/sp-task breakdown                  # Break into tasks
/sp-status                          # Check progress
```

## üìã What It Does

SpecPulse helps you build software systematically:

‚úÖ **Specification First** - Clear specs before coding
‚úÖ **AI-Enhanced** - **Essential** for creating and expanding specifications
‚úÖ **CLI-First Architecture** - Fast, reliable commands for structure
‚úÖ **Privacy-First** - No external API calls, completely local
‚úÖ **Git Integration** - Automatic branch and context management

**Important**: SpecPulse CLI provides the structure, but AI assistants are essential for creating detailed specifications and implementation plans.

---

## ü§ñ AI Integration

### Supported AI Platforms

- **Claude Code** - Custom slash commands (`/sp-*`)
- **Gemini CLI** - Custom commands (`/sp-*`)

### How It Works

**Critical CLI-AI Balance**:

```
User Request: /sp-spec "OAuth2 login with JWT"
    ‚Üì
Step 1: TRY CLI FIRST (Never fail)
    Bash: specpulse spec create "OAuth2 login with JWT"
    ‚Üì
Step 2: CLI creates structure and files
    ‚úì Empty spec file created
    ‚úì Metadata added
    ‚úì Directory structure ready
    ‚Üì
Step 3: AI expands content (Safe file operations)
    Claude reads created file, adds detailed content
    ‚Üì
Step 4: Result: Complete specification
```

**Critical Balance Rules:**
1. **CLI First** - Always try CLI commands first
2. **No CLI Errors** - CLI commands must never fail with valid input
3. **Safe File Operations** - AI only works on files CLI creates
4. **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, Linux without issues
5. **Unicode Safe** - No encoding problems on any platform

---

## üìÅ Project Structure

After initialization:

```
my-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .specpulse/          # All project data
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ specs/           # Feature specifications
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plans/           # Implementation plans
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/           # Development tasks
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memory/          # Project context and decisions
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/       # Specification templates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/             # Claude Code commands
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gemini/             # Gemini CLI commands
```

## üíª Core Commands

### Project Management

```bash
specpulse init <project-name>          # Initialize new project
specpulse init --here --ai claude      # Add to existing project
specpulse doctor                       # Health check
specpulse validate all                 # Validate all components
```

### Feature Development

```bash
specpulse feature init <name>          # Start new feature
specpulse feature continue <id>        # Switch to existing feature
specpulse feature list                 # List all features
```

### Specifications

```bash
specpulse spec create "<description>"  # Create empty template (AI needed for content)
specpulse spec validate [id]           # Validate spec(s)
specpulse spec list                    # List all specs
```

**Note**: `specpulse spec create` creates empty templates. Use AI commands (`/sp-spec`) to fill with detailed content.

### Planning & Tasks

```bash
specpulse plan create "<description>"  # Create empty plan template (AI needed for details)
specpulse task breakdown <plan-id>     # Create empty task breakdown (AI needed for details)
specpulse task list                    # List all tasks
```

**Note**: CLI creates templates, but AI is essential for detailed planning and task breakdown.

## ü§ñ AI Commands (Slash Commands)

### Feature Commands

```bash
/sp-pulse <feature-name>             # Initialize feature
/sp-continue <feature-id>            # Switch to existing feature
/sp-status                          # Track progress across features
```

### Specification Commands (ESSENTIAL)

```bash
/sp-spec create "<description>"      # Create and expand detailed specification
/sp-spec validate <spec-id>         # Validate specification
/sp-spec expand <spec-id>           # Expand existing specification with more details
```

### Planning Commands (ESSENTIAL)

```bash
/sp-plan generate                    # Generate detailed implementation plan
/sp-plan validate <plan-id>         # Validate plan
/sp-plan expand <plan-id>           # Expand plan with more implementation details
```

### Task Commands (ESSENTIAL)

```bash
/sp-task breakdown                   # Break plan into detailed tasks
/sp-task expand <plan-id>           # Expand tasks with implementation details

/sp-execute next                    # Same as above
/sp-execute all                     # Execute ALL pending tasks non-stop
/sp-execute T001                    # Execute specific task
/sp-execute AUTH-T001               # Execute specific service task
/sp-decompose <spec-id>             # Decompose spec into components
/sp-clarify <spec-id>               # Clarify specification
```

## ü§ñ Custom Commands Architecture

### How Custom Commands Work

All `/sp-*` commands follow the same **CLI-First Pattern**:

```
User: /sp-spec "Create user authentication"
    ‚Üì
Step 1: Try CLI Command (Never fails)
    Bash: specpulse spec create "Create user authentication"
    ‚úì Creates empty spec file
    ‚úì Adds metadata
    ‚úì Updates project structure
    ‚Üì
Step 2: AI Expands Content (Safe operations)
    Claude reads the created file
    Claude expands with detailed requirements
    Claude saves the enhanced content
    ‚Üì
Result: Complete, detailed specification
```

### Critical Design Principles

#### ‚úÖ **CLI First, Always**
- Custom commands ALWAYS try CLI commands first
- CLI commands are guaranteed to work on all platforms
- CLI handles cross-platform path and encoding issues
- CLI creates the foundation that AI builds upon

#### ‚úÖ **Safe File Operations**
- AI only works on files that CLI has already created
- AI uses proper encoding and path handling
- AI never creates files in protected directories
- AI respects file permissions and ownership

#### ‚úÖ **Platform Independence**
- Same behavior on Windows, macOS, Linux
- Unicode and emoji support on all platforms
- Automatic path separator handling
- Consistent error handling and recovery

#### ‚úÖ **Error Resilience**
- CLI commands validate input and provide helpful errors
- AI gracefully handles file operation failures
- Built-in recovery mechanisms
- Clear error messages and suggestions

### Custom Command Examples

#### **Specification Creation**
```bash
# User: /sp-spec "OAuth2 authentication with JWT"

# Command execution:
# Step 1: CLI (Always succeeds)
specpulse spec create "OAuth2 authentication with JWT"
# ‚Üí Creates: .specpulse/specs/001-feature/spec-001.md

# Step 2: AI (Safe content expansion)
# Claude reads the created file
# Claude adds detailed requirements, security considerations, API design
# Claude saves the enhanced specification
```

#### **Task Breakdown**
```bash
# User: /sp-task breakdown plan-001

# Command execution:
# Step 1: CLI (Always succeeds)
specpulse task breakdown plan-001
# ‚Üí Creates: .specpulse/tasks/001-feature/task-001.md, task-002.md, etc.

# Step 2: AI (Safe content expansion)
# Claude reads task files
# Claude adds implementation details, dependencies, time estimates
# Claude enhances task descriptions with technical specifics
```

#### **Continuous Execution**
```bash
# User: /sp-execute

# Command execution:
# Step 1: CLI (Status check)
specpulse --no-color doctor
# ‚Üí Gets current project status and pending tasks

# Step 2: AI (Safe task execution)
# Claude reads next task file
# Claude implements the task requirements
# Claude marks task as completed and moves to next
```

### Cross-Platform Handling

#### **Windows (CMD/PowerShell)**
```bash
# Works with Unicode and emojis
/sp-spec "User authentication üîê with JWT tokens"

# Automatic path handling
# CLI: Creates C:\project\.specpulse\specs\001-feature\spec-001.md
# AI: Reads and writes with UTF-8 encoding
```

#### **macOS (zsh/bash)**
```bash
# Works with native macOS paths
/sp-spec "iOS notification system üì±"

# Automatic path handling
# CLI: Creates /Users/user/project/.specpulse/specs/001-feature/spec-001.md
# AI: Reads and writes with proper macOS encoding
```

#### **Linux (bash/zsh)**
```bash
# Works with Linux file permissions
/sp-spec "Docker container orchestration üê≥"

# Automatic path handling
# CLI: Creates /home/user/project/.specpulse/specs/001-feature/spec-001.md
# AI: Reads and writes with proper Linux permissions
```

### Benefits of This Architecture

- ‚úÖ **Reliability**: CLI commands are tested and stable
- ‚úÖ **Consistency**: Same behavior across all platforms
- ‚úÖ **Safety**: AI only operates on CLI-created foundation
- ‚úÖ **Recovery**: Clear error handling and fallback mechanisms
- ‚úÖ **Flexibility**: AI can enhance without breaking core functionality

## üîÑ Task Execution with /sp-execute

### What is /sp-execute?

`/sp-execute` is a **continuous execution mode** that executes tasks without stopping between them. It implements tasks sequentially and automatically moves to the next task until all are completed or blocked.

### How /sp-execute Works

**Non-Stop Execution Pattern:**

```
/sp-execute
    ‚Üì
Step 1: Find next pending task (T001 or AUTH-T001)
    ‚Üì
Step 2: Mark as in-progress: [ ] ‚Üí [>]
    ‚Üì
Step 3: Implement the task
    ‚Üì
Step 4: Mark as completed: [>] ‚Üí [x]
    ‚Üì
Step 5: Automatically continue to next task
    ‚Üì
Repeat until all tasks complete
```

### /sp-execute Usage

In Claude Code or Gemini CLI:

```bash
# Execute next pending task and continue
/sp-execute

# Execute ALL pending tasks non-stop
/sp-execute all

# Execute specific task and continue with related tasks
/sp-execute T001
/sp-execute AUTH-T001
```

### Task Status Markers

- `[ ]` - Pending task (ready to execute)
- `[>]` - In progress (currently working on)
- `[x]` - Completed (done)
- `[!]` - Blocked (waiting for dependency)

### Continuous Execution Example

```bash
# User: /sp-execute

# AI response:
Found 15 pending tasks
Starting with T001: Implementing user model...
‚úì User model created
Moving to T002: Creating authentication service...
‚úì Authentication service implemented
Continue with T003, T004, T005... WITHOUT STOPPING
All 15 tasks completed successfully!
```

### Batch Execution

```bash
# User: /sp-execute all

# AI response:
Processing ALL pending tasks in one go
No interruptions or pauses
Complete the entire task list
Final report only
```

### Non-Stop Execution Rules

**CRITICAL**: `/sp-execute` follows strict non-stop execution rules:

1. **NO EXPLANATIONS** between tasks - just execute
2. **NO WAITING** for confirmation - keep going
3. **NO SUMMARIES** after each task - save for the end
4. **ONLY STOP** when:
   - All tasks completed
   - Hit a blocker
   - Critical error occurs
   - User explicitly says "stop"

### Workflow Integration

#### Starting Fresh

```bash
/sp-pulse new-feature
/sp-spec "Create user authentication with OAuth2"
/sp-plan
/sp-task
/sp-execute all    # Complete everything!
```

#### Resuming Work

```bash
/sp-continue 001-user-auth
/sp-execute        # Continue from where we left off
```

### Error Handling

If an error occurs during task execution:
1. Mark task as blocked: `[!]`
2. Note the error in task file
3. Skip to next available task
4. Continue execution
5. Report all blockers at the end

### Progress Tracking

During execution, AI maintains:
- Task completion counter
- Progress percentage
- List of completed tasks
- List of any blockers encountered

### Final Report Example

```
## Execution Complete

**Progress**: 100% (25/25 tasks)
**Duration**: Continuous execution
**Status**: All tasks completed

### Summary
‚úì 25 tasks completed
‚úó 0 tasks blocked
‚Üí 0 tasks remaining

Ready for validation: /sp-validate
```

### Benefits of /sp-execute

- **Maximum efficiency** - No time wasted between tasks
- **Flow state** - Continuous productive work
- **Rapid delivery** - Complete features faster
- **Reduced context switching** - Stay focused on implementation
- **Automated workflow** - Let AI handle the execution

**Perfect for**: Completing entire feature sets, maintaining momentum, and rapid prototyping.

## ü§ñ CLI vs AI: Essential Partnership

### What CLI Does (Structure)
- ‚úÖ Creates directory structure
- ‚úÖ Generates empty templates
- ‚úÖ Manages metadata and IDs
- ‚úÖ Validates syntax and structure
- ‚úÖ Handles file operations
- ‚úÖ Provides health checks

### What AI Does (Content)
- ‚úÖ **Fills templates with detailed content**
- ‚úÖ **Creates comprehensive specifications**
- ‚úÖ **Generates implementation plans**
- ‚úÖ **Breaks down complex tasks**
- ‚úÖ **Provides technical insights**
- ‚úÖ **Executes implementation tasks**

### They Work Together (Critical Balance)

```
CLI: Creates structure (NEVER FAILS)
AI:  Expands with detailed content
CLI: Validates and organizes
AI:  Suggests improvements
CLI: Manages cross-platform paths
AI:  Executes implementation
```

**Critical Balance**: CLI creates safe, cross-platform foundation. AI adds value without breaking the system.

**Platform Guarantee**: Works identically on Windows, macOS, Linux with proper Unicode handling.
