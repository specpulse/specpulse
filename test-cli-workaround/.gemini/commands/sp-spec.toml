## CRITICAL: LLM Workflow Rules (v2.1.3+)

**PRIMARY WORKFLOW: Use CLI FIRST**
- Use `specpulse sp-spec <action>` commands as PRIMARY method
- CLI handles metadata, validation, and file structure automatically
- Use File Operations ONLY if CLI fails or doesn't exist

**PROTECTED DIRECTORIES (NEVER EDIT):**
- .specpulse/templates/ - Template files
- .specpulse/ - Internal config
- specpulse/ - Package code
- .claude/ and .gemini/ - AI configuration

**WORKFLOW (v2.1.3+):**
1. PRIMARY: Use `specpulse sp-spec create "description"`
2. FALLBACK: If CLI fails, use File Operations
3. Templates are READ from .specpulse/templates/, specs are CREATED/EDITED in .specpulse/.specpulse/specs/

## Command: /sp-spec {{args}}

Create, update, or validate feature specifications using SpecPulse methodology.

Actions: create, update, validate, clarify (defaults to create)

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Detect current feature context**:
   - Read .specpulse/memory/context.md for current feature metadata
   - Use git branch name if available (e.g., 001-user-authentication)
   - Fall back to most recently created feature directory
   - If no context found, ask user to specify feature or run /sp-pulse first

2. **Parse arguments** to determine action:
   - If starts with 'create': Generate new specification
   - If starts with 'update': Modify existing specification
   - If starts with 'validate': Check specification completeness
   - If starts with 'clarify': Address [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   - Default to 'create' with full arguments as description

3. **Run specification validation using CLI (optional)**:
   !{bash specpulse validate spec}

   Note: Validation is optional - manual checks are primary

4. **For 'create' action**:

   **PRIMARY METHOD (v2.1.3+): Use CLI**
   !{bash specpulse sp-spec create "description text here"}

   This creates the spec file with proper metadata and template.
   Then YOU (AI) should:
   1. Read the created spec file
   2. Expand it with full specification details
   3. Edit the file with expanded content
   4. Mark uncertainties with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: question]

   **FALLBACK: File Operations (if CLI fails)**
   - Read template from @{.specpulse/templates/spec.md}
   - Parse description to identify requirements, user stories
   - Fill template with AI-generated content
   - Mark unclear items with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
   - Create numbered spec file (spec-001.md, spec-002.md)
   - Save to .specpulse/.specpulse/specs/XXX-feature/spec-XXX.md

5. **Generate comprehensive specification**:
   - Executive Summary
   - Problem Statement
   - Proposed Solution
   - Functional Requirements (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)
   - Non-Functional Requirements (performance, security, scalability)
   - User Stories with acceptance criteria
   - Technical Constraints
   - Dependencies
   - Risks and Mitigations
   - Success Criteria
   - Open Questions marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

6. **For 'update' action**:
   - Show list of existing spec files
   - Ask user which spec file to update
   - Read selected specification
   - Ask for clarifications or changes
   - Update content while preserving structure
   - Remove resolved [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers

7. **For 'validate' action**:
   - Show list of existing spec files
   - Run validation script
   - Check all required sections are filled
   - Count [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   - Verify acceptance criteria are testable
   - Report validation results

8. **Update context and validate**:
   - Update .specpulse/memory/context.md with specification status
   - Check SDD compliance (Principle 1: Specification First)
   - Validate all sections are filled
   - Report any missing or incomplete sections

### Example AI-Generated Content:
For "User authentication with OAuth2":
- FR-001: System SHALL support OAuth2 authentication with Google/GitHub
- FR-002: System SHALL issue JWT tokens valid for 24 hours
- NFR-001: Authentication response time < 200ms
- User Story: As a user, I want to login with Google so that I don't need to remember another password

### SDD Compliance Checklist:
- [ ] Every requirement is testable (Principle 1)
- [ ] User stories have clear acceptance criteria (Principle 1)
- [ ] Dependencies are identified (Principle 4)
- [ ] Success metrics defined (Principle 6)

Examples:
- /sp-spec user authentication with OAuth2 and email/password
- /sp-spec update
- /sp-spec validate
- /sp-spec clarify
