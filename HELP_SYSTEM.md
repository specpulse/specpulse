## Troubleshooting the Help System

### Unicode Issues
On some Windows terminals, Unicode characters may not display correctly. This is a terminal limitation, not a help system issue.

### Terminal Compatibility
The help system works best with modern terminals that support:
- ANSI color codes
- Unicode characters
- Sufficient terminal width (80+ columns recommended)

### Alternative Access
If terminal issues occur, help content is also available in:
- This documentation file
- Project README
- SPECPULSE_USAGE_GUIDE.md

## Contributing to Help System

The help system is designed to be easily extensible:

### Adding New Topics
1. Add content to the `help_content` dictionary in `specpulse/cli/main.py`
2. Update the topic descriptions in `_show_help_topics()`
3. Add related topics mapping in `_show_help_topic()`
4. Update the `available_commands` list if needed

### Content Guidelines
- Use clear, concise language
- Include practical examples
- Follow the established structure
- Cross-reference related topics
- Test on different terminal configurations
